# The Food Blog Back-End

The tables and database is very scaled down for this staging in developing.
At this stage bloggers and visitors have access to an entry and suggestions
table.  Both blogger and visitor are able to log in and sign up.  Functionality
for the blogger to have administrative rights was originally include however
issues with serializers came up when deploying to heroku so that feature has
been removed.

## Back-end In The Future

Comments table have also been included but not implemented, it will be another
feature to touched upon with further development.  The overall picture of this
project will be to move towards a more data intensive structure.  More data
analysis should be included such as knowing what type of food the blogger eats.
How often he or she visits a site.  What is this person's favorite dish.
